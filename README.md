## Bogosort Vis
Really terrible little application to visualise bogosort over an array of 9 elements.

Written up as a little fun thing to stick on a screen for a LAN, and have chaos occur if it ever sorts the list.

## Build instructions
Should be as simple as just running `cargo build`, after following the setup instructions for egui.

## Runtime expectations
A 'sound.mp3' file is expected to be in the directory with the executable. This is played when the array is sorted.
